# Overview and Introduction

Hello, my name is Brandon Shumin and I have a BS in Computer Engineering from Clemson University and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering with an emphasis on Intelligent System Design.

The purpose of this repository is to provide documentation and source code for various that I have worked on. These projects are organized first by the language that they are written in (or the most applicable field), and then further into sub-projects as necessary.

Some projects listed here are from earlier in my studies and serve to show the improvement in my technique and programming knowledge moreso than my abilities at the time.

If you have any questions about my work or would like to contact me, please email me at bjshumin@gmail.com.

## Usage of my Code

Feel free to use any of the code I have listed here as you see fit in your personal projects. Please do not attempt to use my code in any commercial or academic works without my consent. Thank you!
