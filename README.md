# Overview and Introduction

Hello, my name is Brandon Shumin and I am a Computer Engineering student with a BS from Clemson University.

The purpose of this repository is to provide documentation and source code for various that I have worked on. These projects are organized first by the language that they are written in, and then further into sub-projects as necessary.
