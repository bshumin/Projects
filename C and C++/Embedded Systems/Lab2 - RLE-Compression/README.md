# RLE-Compression

This code allows for compression of any file using RLE compression methods. Commands for compiling the main program (lab2.c) and all helper functions are included in comments at the top of each program. 

Helper Programs:
+ makeTest.c - used to make test data of 3 types: same, alternating, and half-half
+ readHex.c  - displays the hex values of a given file to the console (recommend using pipe operator > to store output to file)
+ readChar.c - displays the char values of a given file to the console (recommend using pipe operator > to store output to file)

NOTE: attempting to run any compiled program incorrectly will display the correct usage and example usage for the executable
